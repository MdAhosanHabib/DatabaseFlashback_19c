In Oracle Database 19c, you have access to several flashback features for database recovery and data 
retrieval. These features allow you to view and recover data as it existed at a previous point in time. 
Here are the main flashback features available in Oracle Database 19c:

1. Flashback Query:
   - Flashback Query allows you to query a table as it appeared at a specific point in time in the past. 
   This is useful for retrieving historical data without having to perform a full database recovery.

2. Flashback Version Query:
   - Flashback Version Query enables you to view all versions of a row within a specified time interval, 
   showing changes made to the data over time.

3. Flashback Transaction Query:
   - Flashback Transaction Query allows you to view all changes made by a specific transaction, including 
   both committed and uncommitted changes, within a specified time interval.

4. Flashback Table:
   - Flashback Table lets you quickly revert a table to a previous state by using a single SQL statement. 
   This operation is useful for recovering from accidental data changes.

5. Flashback Drop:
   - Flashback Drop allows you to recover tables that have been dropped (i.e., deleted) from the database 
   within a specified retention period.

6. Flashback Database:
   - Flashback Database is a feature that enables you to flash back an entire Oracle database to a specific 
   point in time, making it suitable for database-wide recovery.

7. Flashback Data Archive:
   - Flashback Data Archive (also known as Oracle Total Recall) allows you to maintain a historical record 
   of changes to a table over time, providing a comprehensive audit trail.

These flashback features provide a range of options for data recovery, historical data analysis, and 
auditing within Oracle Database 19c, making it easier to manage and maintain data integrity 
and recoverability.
